Project Name: UFW Real-Time Log Monitor

Overview
A desktop application that monitors UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) logs in real-time on Linux systems. 
This tool parses log entries, classifies IP addresses, and displays incoming and outgoing traffic in a color-coded GUI. 
It provides an intuitive interface to track firewall activity without using the terminal.

Features

1. Real-time monitoring of UFW log entries
2. Color-coded log lines: red for blocked traffic, green for allowed traffic
3. Classifies IP addresses (Private, Public, Loopback, Multicast, Reserved, Link-local)
4. Displays timestamps, source, and destination IP addresses
5. Scrollable textbox with live updates
6. Dark-themed modern GUI using CustomTkinter
7. Handles large logs efficiently using threading

Tech Stack

1. Python 3
2. CustomTkinter and Tkinter for GUI
3. `subprocess` for following log files
4. `re` for regex parsing of log entries
5. `ipaddress` for IP classification
6. `datetime` for timestamp formatting
7. Threading for non-blocking real-time updates

Setup Requirements

1. Install required Python packages from `requirements.txt`: run pip install -r requirements.txt


2. On Linux, ensure Tkinter is installed: run sudo apt install python3-tk


3. Requires sudo permissions to read `/var/log/ufw.log`. Run the app with: python ufwlog2.py then wirte ur sudo pass in terminal


Usage

1. Launch the application: run sudo python ufwlog2.py


2. The GUI will display new UFW log entries as they happen
3. Blocked entries appear in red, allowed entries appear in green
4. Source and destination IP addresses are classified for easier interpretation

Purpose
This project was built to practice Python GUI development, real-time log processing, regex parsing, and threading. 
It provides a user-friendly way to monitor firewall activity and analyze network traffic visually.

Future Improvements

1. Filter logs by action (ALLOW/BLOCK) or IP type
2. Add search functionality for specific IPs or timestamps
3. Include export to CSV or JSON for further analysis
4. Enable notifications for suspicious activity
5. Improve performance for very large log files
