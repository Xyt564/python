Project Name: Basic Wiki App

Overview
A simple desktop wiki application built with Python, CustomTkinter, and Tkinter. 
It uses a JSON file for data storage, allowing users to create, edit, and manage wiki pages in a clean graphical interface.

Features
1) Create, edit, and view wiki pages
2) Store and load data from wiki.json
3) Modern interface using CustomTkinter and Tkinter
4) Lightweight and easy to run locally
5) Support for multiple pages with quick access

Tech Stack
1) Python 3
2) CustomTkinter and Tkinter for GUI
3) JSON for page storage
4) OS, threading, and time modules for system tasks and responsiveness

Setup Requirement
The app requires you to set the path where the `wiki.json` file will be stored. Update the `data_dir` variable in the code with the path to your repository. 

Example:
---------- DATA FILE ----------
data_dir = ""  # Include your file path to where you've saved the repo, e.g. ~/downloads/wiki
os.makedirs(data_dir, exist_ok=True)
wiki_file = os.path.join(data_dir, "wiki.json")
if not os.path.exists(wiki_file):
    with open(wiki_file, "w") as f:
        json.dump({}, f)

Purpose
This project was created to practice Python GUI development and JSON-based data management. It can be used as a personal wiki or note-taking tool.

7. Future Improvements
4) Add export to text or markdown
5) Dark and light theme switching

The required packages are stored in the requirements.txt just run pip install -r requirements.txt to download them
Also for tkinter run - sudo apt install python3-tk
