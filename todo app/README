Project Name: Python To-Do List

Overview
A simple command-line To-Do List application built with Python. 
The app allows users to manage daily tasks by adding, deleting, and marking them as complete. 
Tasks are saved locally in a JSON file to maintain persistence across sessions.

Features

1. Add new tasks with custom titles
2. Delete tasks by number
3. Mark tasks as complete
4. View all tasks with a clear visual status indicator (✅ for completed, ❌ for pending)
5. Persistent storage in `tasks.json`
6. Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
7. Lightweight and fast, runs entirely in the terminal

Tech Stack

1. Python 3
2. JSON for local task storage
3. OS and platform modules for cross-platform screen clearing

Setup Requirements

1. Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system
2. No additional Python packages are required, all dependencies are standard libraries
3. Clone the repository and run: python3 todo.py


Usage

1. Run the program and follow the menu prompts
2. Add tasks using option 1
3. Delete tasks using option 2
4. Mark tasks as complete using option 3
5. View all tasks using option 4
6. Quit the program using option 5

Purpose
This project was created to practice Python programming, JSON data management, and command-line interfaces. 
It is a lightweight tool for managing daily tasks efficiently.

Future Improvements

1. Add due dates and reminders for tasks
2. Implement categories or tags for tasks
3. Add search and filtering options
4. Create a GUI version using Tkinter or CustomTkinter
5. Allow exporting tasks to text or CSV files
