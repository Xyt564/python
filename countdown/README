Project Name: Countdown Timer App

Overview
A sleek and simple desktop countdown timer built with Python, CustomTkinter, and Tkinter. 
The app allows users to set a countdown in minutes and seconds, then start, pause, resume, or reset the timer. 
When the countdown reaches zero, an alarm sound is played to notify the user. 
This project demonstrates GUI development, user input handling, and multimedia integration in Python.

Features

1. Input countdown time in minutes and seconds
2. Start, pause, resume, and reset functionality
3. Visual countdown display with large, easy-to-read digits
4. Plays a sound alarm when time is up
5. Modern dark-themed interface using CustomTkinter

Tech Stack

1. Python 3
2. CustomTkinter and Tkinter for GUI
3. `playsound` package for alarm notifications
4. OS module for handling file paths

Setup Requirements

1. Install required Python packages from `requirements.txt`: run pip install -r requirements.txt

2. On Linux systems, make sure Tkinter is installed: run sudo apt install python3-tk

3. Ensure an `alarm.wav` file is present in the same directory as the script.

4. Run the script: python3 countdown_app.py


Purpose
This project was built to practice Python GUI development, event-driven programming, and multimedia integration. 
It can be used as a personal timer for productivity, study sessions, workouts, or any other activity that requires time tracking.

Future Improvements

1. Add multiple preset timers (e.g., Pomodoro technique)
2. Allow custom alarm sounds
3. Include notifications outside the app window
4. Dark/light theme toggle or custom color themes
5. Add keyboard shortcuts for faster control
