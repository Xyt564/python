Absolutely! Here’s a clean, professional **README** you can use for your GitHub repo. I’ve included sections for setup, usage, requirements, and a brief explanation of how it works.

# Keylogger Project

A simple Python keylogger with a Flask server for capturing and viewing keystrokes.

**⚠️ Disclaimer:** This project is for **educational purposes only**. Do **not** use it on devices you don’t own or have permission to monitor.

---

## Features

* Records keystrokes using `pynput`
* Automatically creates a local log file if it doesn’t exist
* Sends captured keystrokes to a Flask server
* View captured logs in a clean, readable web interface
* Handles special keys like Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Backspace, Enter, Tab

---

## Requirements

All Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`:

```
Flask
pynput
requests
MarkupSafe
```

Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For Linux, you may also need system dependencies for `pynput`:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-wheel libevdev-dev
```

---

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

2. **Start the server:**

```bash
python3 server.py
```

By default, the server runs on `http://0.0.0.0:5000`. Open in your browser:

```
http://<server-ip>:5000/view
```

3. **Start the keylogger:**

```bash
python3 keylogger.py
```

Keystrokes will be sent to the server and also saved locally in `keylog.txt`.

├── server.py          # Flask server to receive and display logs
├── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies
├── keylog.txt         # Local log file (created automatically)
└── README.md
```

## Usage

* Run the server first, then the keylogger.
* Navigate to `/view` on your server in a browser to see captured logs.
* Press `ESC` in the keylogger to stop logging.

## Notes

* Ensure your firewall allows connections if running the server on a separate machine.
* This project is intended for learning purposes, testing in controlled environments only.
