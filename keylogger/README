Keylogger Project

A simple Python keylogger with a Flask server for capturing and viewing keystrokes.

Disclaimer: This project is for educational purposes only. 
Do not use it on devices you don’t own or have permission to monitor.


Features

1. Records keystrokes using `pynput`
2. Automatically creates a local log file if it doesn’t exist
3. Sends captured keystrokes to a Flask server
4. View captured logs in a clean, readable web interface
5. Handles special keys like Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Backspace, Enter, Tab

Requirements

1. Python 3.8 or higher

2. Python dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

   * Flask
   * pynput
   * requests
   * MarkupSafe

3. Install dependencies using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. For Linux users, system dependencies may be required for `pynput`:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install python3-dev python3-wheel libevdev-dev
   ```

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
 https://github.com/Xyt564/python.git/Keylogger
   cd Keylogger
   ```

2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   python3 server.py
   ```

   The server runs on `http://0.0.0.0:5000` by default. Open in a browser:

   ```
   http://<server-ip>:5000/view
   ```

3. Start the keylogger:

   ```bash
   python3 keylogger.py
   ```

   Keystrokes will be sent to the server and saved locally in `keylog.txt`.


File Structure

1. `keylogger.py` – Main keylogger script
2. `server.py` – Flask server to receive and display logs
3. `requirements.txt` – Python dependencies
4. `keylog.txt` – Local log file (created automatically)
5. `README.md` – This file

Usage

1. Run the server first, then the keylogger.
2. Navigate to `/view` on your server in a browser to see captured logs.
3. Press `ESC` in the keylogger to stop logging.


Notes
1. Ensure your firewall allows connections if running the server on a separate machine.
2. This project is intended for learning purposes, testing in controlled environments only.
