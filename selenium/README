Selenium Google Bot

A Python bot using Selenium to open Google, automatically accept the cookies consent popup, and perform basic automated browsing. Ideal for learning browser automation.


Features

* Opens Google in a browser automatically.
* Detects and clicks the "Accept all" button on the cookies consent popup.
* Compatible with Firefox and Chrome.
* Lightweight and easy to set up for personal use or learning Selenium.

Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+
* Selenium Python package (installed via your `requirements.txt`)
* A browser (Firefox or Chrome) installed on your system

Install dependencies from your `requirements.txt`: pip install -r requirements.txt

Browser Drivers

Selenium requires **drivers** specific to the browser you want to automate.

Firefox

1. Download GeckoDriver from [Mozilla GeckoDriver releases](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases).

2. Choose the **Linux 64-bit** version (not ARM/AARCH64 unless your CPU is ARM).

3. Extract it and move it into your project folder: mv geckodriver /path/to/project/ then chmod +x geckodriver


4. Ensure your script points to the driver if necessary: i marked the spot using "##" as to where u should add your driver path

Chrome

1. Download **ChromeDriver** matching your installed Chrome version from [ChromeDriver downloads](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).

2. Extract it and move it to your project folder: chromedriver /path/to/project/ then chmod +x chromedriver


3. Initialize the driver in your script: i marked the spot using "##" as to where u should add your driver path


Important: ChromeDriver version must match your Chrome version exactly.

Usage

1. Navigate to your project folder: cd /path/to/selenium


2. Run the bot using: python3 bot.py


3. The bot will:

   * Open your browser (Firefox or Chrome).
   * Navigate to Google.
   * Automatically accept the cookies consent popup.


Notes & Tips

Google may detect automation and display captchas. To reduce this:

  * Avoid too many requests in a short period.
  * Use realistic delays, scrolling, or mouse movements.
  * Consider randomizing user-agent strings.

* Make sure your driver binaries are **executable**: by running chmod +x geckodriver or chmod +x chromedriver


This bot is intended for **personal use and learning**. Do not violate website terms of service.
