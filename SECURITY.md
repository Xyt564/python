Perfect! Here's a more **structured, detailed, and professional** `SECURITY.md` for your GitHub repo, tailored for your learning/personal projects:

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is primarily for personal experimentation and learning purposes. All versions are maintained for **personal security fixes**.
No formal enterprise or production-level security support is provided.

| Version | Supported            | Notes                                                              |
| ------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| All     | :white\_check\_mark: | Updates are provided for critical issues or personal improvements. |



## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a potential security vulnerability:

1. **Report it responsibly**: Open an issue in this repository or contact the maintainer directly.
2. **Include details**: Provide clear reproduction steps, affected script or module, and any relevant system information.
3. **Expected response**: Critical vulnerabilities will be acknowledged and fixed as quickly as possible. Non-critical or non-reproducible issues may not receive immediate attention.
4. **Responsible disclosure**: Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until it has been addressed.

> ⚠️ Note: These projects are for learning purposes. Avoid running them against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test. Using them on third-party services may violate laws or terms of service.



## Recommended Safety Practices

Even though these projects are designed to be safe:

* **Sandbox your environment**: Use virtual environments (`venv`) for Python dependencies.
* **Browser automation**: When using Selenium or other bots, use test accounts and avoid interacting with live sensitive systems.
* **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update packages in `requirements.txt` to reduce exposure to known vulnerabilities.
* **Review code before running**: Always inspect scripts before executing, especially if modifying or adding third-party code.



## Third-Party Drivers and Dependencies

Some projects depend on browser drivers or external tools:

* **Chrome**: Requires Chrome browser and `chromedriver`. Versions must match the installed Chrome version.
* **Firefox**: Requires Firefox and `geckodriver`. Versions must match the installed Firefox version.
* **Selenium/WebScraping**: Ensure the drivers are downloaded from official sources and are executable on your OS.
* **Python packages**: Listed in `requirements.txt`. Install in a virtual environment to isolate from system Python.

> Using mismatched drivers may cause unexpected errors or browser detection issues. Always follow official installation instructions for each driver.
