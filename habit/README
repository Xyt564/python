Project Name: Habit Tracker

Overview
A simple command-line habit tracker built with Python. 
This app allows you to add habits, mark them as completed for the day, and view your progress over time. 
Progress is saved in a local JSON file so your data is persistent across sessions.

Features

1. Add new habits to track
2. Mark habits as completed for the current day
3. View progress with a simple text-based progress chart
4. Data stored in a JSON file for persistence
5. Lightweight and easy to run locally

Tech Stack

1. Python 3
2. JSON for storing habit data
3. OS and datetime modules for file handling and dates

Data Storage
The app automatically creates a `habits.json` file in the same directory as the script. All progress is stored there.

Usage

1. Run the script in your terminal by running Python3 habit.py

2. Choose from the menu options:

   * Add Habit
   * Mark Habit Done
   * View Progress
   * Exit

Purpose

This project was built to practice Python basics such as file handling, JSON storage, and simple command-line interfaces. 
It provides a lightweight way to build consistency by tracking habits.

Future Improvements

1. Add streak tracking and statistics
2. Allow deleting habits
3. Add support for editing habit names
4. Visualize progress with graphs or calendars
5. Export data to CSV or text
