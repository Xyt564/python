Project Name: Olympus: The Twelve Gods

Overview

A fun and interactive **desktop app** built with Python and CustomTkinter, showcasing the twelve Olympian gods from Greek mythology. 
Users can explore each god via clickable cards, view detailed popups containing descriptions, domains, epithets, family relations, famous myths, symbols, and fun facts. 
This project demonstrates GUI design, image handling, and dynamic layouts in Python.

Features

1. Scrollable interface with cards for each of the twelve Olympian gods
2. Clickable cards to display detailed popups for each god
3. Includes descriptions, Roman names, domains, epithets, symbols, family, myths, and fun facts
4. Preloads images for visual representation of gods
5. Responsive layout that adjusts card grid based on window size
6. Modern dark-themed GUI using CustomTkinter

Tech Stack

1. Python 3
2. CustomTkinter and Tkinter for GUI
3. Pillow (PIL) for image handling and resizing
4. OS and random modules for file management and dynamic features

Setup Requirements

1. Install required packages from `requirements.txt`: run pip install -r requirements.txt


2. On Linux systems, ensure Tkinter is installed: run sudo apt install python3-tk


3. Place images for each god in an `images` folder within the same directory as the script. 
Filenames should match the god’s name (case-insensitive).

Usage

1. Run the script: python3 olympus_app.py


2. Scroll through the cards to view all twelve gods
3. Click any god card to open a detailed popup with additional information
4. Explore myths, symbols, epithets, domains, and fun facts for each god

Purpose
This project was created for fun and learning, combining Python GUI skills with creativity. 
It demonstrates how to build interactive applications with dynamic layouts, handle images, and display structured data in a visually engaging way. 
It’s a playful exploration of mythology while practicing Python programming and GUI design.

Future Improvements

1. Add search or filter functionality to quickly find a god
2. Include animations or transitions for popups
3. Allow users to add their own mythological figures
4. Add more multimedia elements such as sound or video
5. Enhance responsiveness for different screen sizes
